# Best Practices for Using Sensor Web Technology

This tutorial has been developed within the
[ConnectinGEO](http://connectingeo.net/) project in order
to lower the hurdle to create interoperable solutions using Sensor Web
technology. It gives an overview on the relevant standards and the related
technology. In order to give the users a jump start, it uses exemplary
scenarios to illustrate the different approaches.
